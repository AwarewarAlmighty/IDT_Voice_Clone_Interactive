# IDT Voice Clone Interactive – Historical Figures Speak

## Project Overview
This project transforms a traditional history lesson into an interactive learning experience where students can click on historical figures and hear short, contextually relevant quotes spoken in the figure’s voice. The goal is to enhance engagement while maintaining historical accuracy and conservative educational framing.

This prototype was developed as part of the **IDT Voice Clone Interactive** assignment.

## Learning Objective
Students and teachers using this prototype should be able to:
- Click on a historical figure
- Hear the figure speak a historically relevant quote
- Understand how the quote connects to lesson content
- Make connections between leadership, self-government, and nation-building
- Engage with history in a more immersive way

## Historical Figures Included
- **Lee Kuan Yew** – Founding Prime Minister of Singapore  
- **Tunku Abdul Rahman** – First Prime Minister of Malaysia  
- **David Marshall** – Singapore’s first Chief Minister  

Each figure includes **two short quotes** connected to the lesson topic of self-government and independence.

## Voice Approach (Important Note)
All audio in this prototype uses **AI-trained voice approximations** generated for educational prototyping purposes.

- Voices were trained using publicly available speech recordings.
- Outputs were reviewed for accent stability, tone appropriateness, and clarity.
- Generated voices are **not presented as definitive or authentic reconstructions**, but as approximations to support interactive learning design.
