# Challenges and Solutions

This document outlines key challenges encountered during development and how they were addressed.

---

## 1. Voice Authenticity and Accuracy
**Challenge:**  
AI-generated voices may drift in accent, tone, or cadence, risking misrepresentation of historical figures.

**Solution:**  
- Short, neutral quotes were selected.
- Emotional or rhetorical phrasing was avoided.
- Outputs were reviewed manually before inclusion.
- Voices are labeled as **AI-trained approximations**, not authentic recreations.

---

## 2. Accent Drift During Voice Generation
**Challenge:**  
Some AI voice generations exhibited accent instability (e.g., non-regional pronunciation).

**Solution:**  
- Training audio was carefully trimmed to include clear, uninterrupted speech.
- Generation settings were kept consistent across quotes.
- Only outputs with stable accent and delivery were used.

## 3. Risk of Audiobook-Style Narration
**Challenge:**  
AI voices can sound like narrators rather than historical speakers.

**Solution:**  
- Quotes were written as direct statements rather than narrative text.
- Sentences were kept short and declarative.
- Style exaggeration was disabled during generation.

## 4. Balancing Checklist Requirements with Accuracy
**Challenge:**  
The submission checklist required all figures to have trained voices, while historical accuracy needed to be preserved.

**Solution:**  
- Voice training was documented clearly.
- AI usage was framed as **educational prototyping**, not historical reconstruction.
- Decisions were explained transparently in documentation.

## 5. Time Constraints
**Challenge:**  
Limited time required prioritization of deliverables.

**Solution:**  
- Focused on a clean, functional prototype rather than advanced features.
- Limited voice generation to two quotes per figure.
- Prioritized clarity, documentation, and correctness over quantity.

## Reflection
These challenges reinforced the importance of critical judgment when using AI in educational contexts. Conservative design choices were intentionally made to support learning objectives while minimizing risk.
